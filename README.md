## Why this library exists

Joyfill is a forms platform with APIs and SDKs built to take the burden of building form and pdf solutions off of developers and product teams. Our Embeddable Form SDKs for JS, Angular, Vue, React, React-Native, etc. utilize this library to handle the visibility evaluation logic for fields and pages. We have open sourced this library to enable other developers to utilize the same conditional logic we use. Enjoy!
